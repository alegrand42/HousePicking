House Picking. The API fetchs house data from the site `https://www.morissimmobilier.com/recherche-immobiliere-avancee/?advanced_city=&surface-min=0&nb-chambres-min=0&budget-max=5000000`.
The front shows all these data here `http://localhost:8080/#/home` and here `http://localhost:8080/#/house`

## Setup
It needs Vuesjs and rails commands which are detailed on their own repository.
